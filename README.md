# SDS-384-Final-Project

## Project: Student Performance on exams

The project will be split into two parts, where the first we will try to establish patterns in the data through doing exploratory analysis as we believe that there are some underlying trends within the data.

From this exploration, we can then see if we can use these trends to predict the various different testing scores for each student.

Currently, our hypothesis' are the following:

1. The higher the education level, the higher the testing scores the student will get.
2. There is an inverse relationship between writing and reading scores and a students math score.

## Goals

As described in the Project section, we wish to find first correlation in the data given scores, then try to apply regression techniques to see if we can predict a students score.

## Data information

The data consists of 8 features:
1. Gender
2. Race/Ethnicity (which has been anonymized)
3. Parental level of education
4. If they had free and reduced lunch (a financial level indicator)
5. Whether they prepared for the test
6. Math Score
7. Reading Score
