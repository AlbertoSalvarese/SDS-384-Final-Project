## Project: Student Performance on exams

Abstract: This study aims to model student exam performance as a function of several variables such as academic indicators, demographics, family background and others, and trying to evaluate which features contribute the most in
determining studentsâ€™ academic success, to have a better understanding on where to intervene to guarantee fairness.

## Structure of Code

The code has been divided in three jupyter notebooks:

1. Feature Exploration: Contains all the techniques used for feature exploration and associated inferences
2. Modeling and Results - 1: Contains model training and validation for Gaussian Process, Kernel Ridge, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest (File is big in size so might take a while to load)
3. Modeling and Results - 2: Contains model training and results for Predictor + GAN Neural Network
